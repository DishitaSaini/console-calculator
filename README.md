# C++ Console Calculator with History Logging

This is a simple C++ console-based calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. In addition to performing calculations, the program logs every operation into a history file (`history.txt`), allowing users to view past calculations or clear the history at any time.

The project uses basic C++ programming concepts such as control structures, functions, and file handling (using `ofstream` and `ifstream`). The code is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to understand for beginners learning C++.

# Features:
- Perform basic calculations: + , − , × , ÷
- Save each calculation to a history file
- View all past operations from history
- Option to clear history log
- Fully terminal-based interface

# Technologies Used:
- C++ Programming Language
- File I/O (`fstream` library)

# How to Run:
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator


# Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Add advanced functions (Square Root, Power)
- User-specific history files
- Convert to GUI application using Qt
- Save history in a structured format (JSON/Database)

This project is ideal for anyone learning basic C++ programming, especially file handling and menu-driven programs.
